EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Phortitude.php allows execution of arbitrary PHP
code by remote agents and MUST NOT be deployed where publicly available.

Phorth was created around Feb-Mar 2010 while I was researching the
feasibility of mnemonic values and operations for on-the-fly explanation
of business logic to the end-users. It's a stack-based eDSL, influenced
to an extent by Forth and Factor, as well as certain FP approaches.

As of 0.0.11b, its utility is nonexistent. There's a slew of pretty nasty
bugs in it, mnemonic values per se are not even implemented and thanks to
faulty fundamental design there are some severe problems with proper
scoping and memory usage.

The project was eventually abandoned as I realized that:

1). Crufty syntax would represent a severe obstacle to using this for
specifying business logic in any practical setting.

2). Memory requirements were extremely steep for the benefit this
approach could potentially provide - even assuming the existing issues
could be resolved.

3). Any attempt at practical usage would require a from the ground up
redesign and rewrite, with fairly bleak prospects of actually getting any
mileage out of it.
